The target audience for this project is the foreigners, who are not currently residing in Manhattan, that are looking into opening a restaurant business. For a foreigner starting a business in an unfamiliar location, the first concern will be the safety. Is the location safe enough for a foreigner to open a business? Is it close to the neighbourhood with high crime rates? This report will analyse the crime data in Manhattan by using the techniques learnt in this IBM course and select a few locations that have low crime rates. The second concern will be to know about the popular venues in the locations. The popular venues in the location can tell us about the people and the needs of the neighbourhood. For example, if we see cafes and pards as most popular venues in the location, the needs will be a food that can be taken away or food trucks. The report will analyse the foursquare venue data in Manhattan to see the trend and potential needs of the locations that were selected previously.",

Each record represents an arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD and includes information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. In addition, information related to suspect demographics is also included. This data can be used by the public to explore the nature of police enforcement activity. \n",
